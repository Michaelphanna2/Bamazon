# Bamazon
Bamazon Customer App

-Created a SQL database that contains an inventory list of items to purchase, including the number available in stock, as well as the cost per item.

-Created the Bamazon customer JavaScript file which creates the connection to the SQL database using my local host and prompts the user through the node interface.

-When the BamazonCustomer.js file is run, the user is shown the inventory list populated from SQL, and prompted to select the item ID number of the item they wish to purchase.

-Once selected, the user is then prompted to indicate how many they wish to purchase. If there is enough in stock, the user will be shown the total cost. If there is not enough in stock, the user will be told there isn't enough and prompted to try again.
